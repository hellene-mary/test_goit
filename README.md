Hello and welcome to this GitHub repository! 
This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is a test task from GoIt.

The application is written in React, and the styles are implemented using module.css. The goal of this task is to create a user card and add interactivity when the user clicks on the Follow button.

According to the layout, the user card should include an avatar, the number of followers, the number of tweets, and a Follow button. When the user clicks on the Follow button, the text on the button changes to Following, and the color of the button changes. The number of followers should also increase by one. The final result of the user's actions should be saved when the page is refreshed.

If the user clicks on the button again, the text and color of the button should return to their original state, and the number of followers should decrease by one.

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine, install the necessary dependencies, and then run the project using the command "npm start". Remember to run "npm run build" before deploying the app in a production environment.

Thank you for taking the time to read this README file. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
